Final Project - Image Completion with Structure Propagation

-- Contents
* main.py - The top-level script to run the Structure Propagation + Texture Propagation
* main.sh - Top-level Bash script to call main.py for each set of images with the appropriate input parameters
* output_images - The output images that were chosen for each set of sample images; all of these images (plus the other images that did not get selected) can be generated by running main.sh
* sample_images - The original images, along with the unknown and structure masks for each; each sample has a separate sub-directory
* structprop.py - The Structure Propagation implementation
* textprop.py - The Texture Propagation implementation

-- Code

First, make sure you are in the "resources" directory.

Activate environment:
$ conda activate CS6475

Run the top-level Bash script to generate all output images for each sample image set:
$ bash main.sh

Note:
 - All output images will be output to the current directory and will contain filenames with suffixes explaining which texture propagation method was used (or if structure propagation only)
 - The main.sh Bash script should take approximately 35 minutes to run (apologies for not having more performance-oriented code)

To run the main.py script directly, see the help menu:
$ python main.py --help

Alternatively, the individual commands from within main.sh can also be called directly, e.g.:
$ python main.py -s pumpkin -i 15 -p 15 -x 2 -f
